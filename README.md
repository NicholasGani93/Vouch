## Time spent

24 hours

## Assumptions made

- Will load previous chat by join the room
- Multiple user can join a single room
- Each user can only join one room at once
- Chat only text format

## Shortcuts/Compromises made
- I feel like using message broker will be more proper
- Need to complete unit test
- Implement docker
- More validation
- Maybe encrypt the message (depends on the use case)
- More refactor the code
- Split repository between frontend and backend

## Assume your application will go into production...
- Running unit testing, with at least 70% code coverage
- Running black box testing based on use case
- Running load test for expected user
- Implement cors, https protocol, auth key, message encryption

## What did you not include
- Docker implementation
- Message broker
- Unit test

## Feedback
It is too sudden especialy since I need to prepare the correct environment in my local computer.
